#+TITLE: Org Pandoc Import
#+AUTHOR: tecosaur

The worst part about =org-mode=? Having to leave it.

This package aims to reduce this pain by leveraging [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] to convert selected
file types /to/ org.

*There are two tiers of non-org file avoidance:*

 1. The basic "get me out of here" ---
    ~org-pandoc-import-{to,as}-org~ allows you to easily convert supported non-org
    files to an org file/buffer with Pandoc
 2. "I don't even want to /see/ non-org files" --- ~org-pandoc-import-transient-mode~
    is for you
    - (via file handlers) intercepts requests for non-org files it knows it can convert
    - uses ~org-pandoc-import-to-org~ to convert the file to a temporary org file
    - opens this org file instead
    - exports back to the original non-org file on save

* Installation

** Straight
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package org-pandoc-import
  :straight (:host github
             :repo "tecosaur/org-pandoc-import"
             :files ("*.el" "filters" "preprocessors")))
#+END_SRC
** Doom
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(package! org-pandoc-import
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "tecosaur/org-pandoc-import"
           :files ("*.el" "filters" "preprocessors")))
#+END_SRC

* Default backends
+ markdown :: associated with: =.md=, =.markdown=
+ LaTeX :: associated with: =.tex=, =.latex=
+ reStructuredText :: (~rst~) associated with: =.rst=
+ ODT :: associated with: =.odt=
+ DOCX :: associated with: =.docx=
+ Jupyter Notebooks :: (~ipynb~) associated with: =.ipynb=
+ Rmarkdown :: (~markdown~) associated with: =.Rmd=, =.rmd=
+ CSV :: associated with: =.csv=
+ TSV :: (~csv~) associated with: =.tsv=

Currently /Rmarkdown/ and /TSV/ files require ~sed~ in order to pre-process the file
for Pandoc.

** Default transient-mode backends
Please note that this mode is off by default.
It is however a global mode, so enable it once in your config and it will be
active everywhere.

The active transient backends are determined by
~org-pandoc-import-transient-associations~.

+ markdown :: using Org's ~gfm~ export if available, otherwise ~md~
+ ODT :: using Org's ~odt~ export
+ csv, tsv :: using ~org-table-export~
When ~ox-pandoc~ is available, the following formats are also enabled by default,
and use ~ox-pandoc~ to export.
+ =rst=
+ =docx=

* Adding new backends
For something supported out of the box by Pandoc, it couldn't be easier ---
just
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(org-pandoc-import-backend foo)
#+END_SRC

This will add ~foo~ to ~org-pandoc-import-backends~, and create the following
functions
+ ~org-pandoc-import-foo-as-org~
+ ~org-pandoc-import-foo-to-org~
Which will reference these variables,
+ ~org-pandoc-import-foo-args~
+ ~org-pandoc-import-foo-filters~
+ ~org-pandoc-import-foo-preprocessors~
+ ~org-pandoc-import-foo-extensions~
That last variable will be set to ~("foo")~, and will cause
~org-pandoc-import-{to,as}-org~ to automatically select this backend when called
on =.foo= files.

These all have docstrings --- check them out!
